    <h1>Ducks fractal zoom</h1>
    <p>This animation is a zoom in on something called a Ducks Fractal.</p>
    <p>A Ducks fractal is defined as a julia set of the function 𝒇(𝒛) = 𝒍𝒏(𝑰𝒂𝒃𝒔(𝒛)+𝒄) where  𝑰𝒂𝒃𝒔(𝒛) = (𝐈𝐦(𝒛) > 𝟎)? 𝒛 : 𝒛* for a point 𝒛=𝒙+𝒊𝒚 and some complex constant 𝒄</p>
    <p>A ducks fractal will only exhibit fractal complexity if the point 𝒄 is between two specific arcs with vertices at 𝟏 and -𝟏-𝛑𝒊. Since in my program 𝒄 is randomly chosen you may need to reload the website a few times to get a result with fractal complexity</p>
    <p>unlike the very well known mandelbrot set, the ducks fractal is just an interesting fractal somebody found and wrote about online</p>
