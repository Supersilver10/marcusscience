    <h1>Mandelbrot fractal zoom</h1>
    <p>This animation is a zoom in on something called the Mandelbrot set.</p>
    <p>The Mandelbrot set is the set of complex numbers 𝒄 for which the function 𝒇(𝒛)=𝒛²+𝒄 does not diverge to infinity when iterated from 𝒛 = 𝟎</p>
    <p>Images of the Mandelbrot set exhibit an elaborate and infinitely complicated boundary that reveals progressively ever-finer recursive detail at increasing magnifications</p>
    <p>In my animation I am taking points 𝒙+𝒊𝒚 and coloring them black if they are in the set and otherwise coloring them with a logarithmic gradient based on how many iterations a point goes through before it escapes and its distance from the center when it escapes</p>
