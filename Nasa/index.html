      NASA HUNCH is an Engineering program/competition for high school students held by NASA.
      This is my second year doing it. Last year my project was one of three projects selected by NASA as finalists/winners in our category. As a finalist I got to go to the Johnson Space Center in Houston and present in front of NASA executives, engineers, and astronauts.
